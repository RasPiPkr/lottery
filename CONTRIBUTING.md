Please fork this repository and contribute by adding your country as a branch.

The one thing I ask is that to keep all text in english so it's readable by all users and contributors.

Please keep the current code in place just copy the nearest functions already in the code and paste it as your own function.

Try to keep to the same naming of certain variables so that you would use the getNumbers function.

When you have created your contribution, please make a pull request for approval.
